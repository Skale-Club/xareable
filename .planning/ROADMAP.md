## 🚧 v1.2 Production Hardening (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Close the highest-risk gaps in production accumulated through v1.0 + v1.1 — security (rate limiting), reliability (SSE timer leak, React Error Boundary), verification of destructive cron operations, and dependency hygiene.

**Phases:**

- [ ] **Phase 13: Production Hardening Fixes** — Rate limit AI endpoints, fix SSE timer leak, add React Error Boundary, prune dead deps
- [ ] **Phase 14: Cron Verification Harness** — Automated harness asserting trash sweep, purge sweep, and overage batch behave correctly against seeded data

### Phase 13: Production Hardening Fixes
**Goal**: Close four independent production-code gaps — abuse protection on paid AI endpoints, deterministic SSE timer cleanup, app-wide render-error recovery, and removal of unused security-surface packages.
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v1.2)
**Requirements**: HARD-01, HARD-02, HARD-03, HARD-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. An authenticated user exceeding the configured per-user rate limit on any of `/api/generate`, `/api/edit-post`, `/api/transcribe`, `/api/carousel/generate`, `/api/enhance` receives HTTP 429 with `Retry-After`, and Gemini is not billed for rejected requests.
  2. Forcing `sse.sendError` to throw during a generation no longer leaks the SSE safety timer — `safetyTimer` is cleared on every termination path.
  3. A render error in any descendant of `<App>` shows a user-facing recovery UI ("Something went wrong" + Retry) and logs the error with stack and component info; the SPA does not go blank.
  4. `package.json` no longer lists `passport`, `passport-local`, `@types/passport`, `@types/passport-local`, `express-session`, `connect-pg-simple`, or `memorystore`; `@octokit/rest` lives under `devDependencies`; `npm install && npm run check && npm run build` all succeed.
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 13-01-PLAN.md — Server hardening: per-user rate limit on 5 paid AI endpoints (HARD-01) + SSE safetyTimer cleanup moved into finally blocks across generate/edit/carousel/enhance (HARD-02)
- [ ] 13-02-PLAN.md — Frontend recovery + dependency hygiene: ErrorBoundary at App root with PT/ES translations (HARD-03) + remove dead session/auth packages and relocate @octokit/rest to devDependencies (HARD-04)
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 14: Cron Verification Harness
**Goal**: Provide an automated, repeatable harness that exercises the three destructive scheduled jobs shipped in Phase 11 and Phase 12 against seeded test data and asserts their observable side effects.
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: VRFY-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running `scripts/verify-cron-jobs.ts` (or equivalent) seeds three controlled scenarios — past-due posts awaiting trash, posts past `TRASH_RETENTION_DAYS` awaiting purge with their image/thumbnail/slides/enhancement-source storage objects, and `user_billing_profiles` with `pending_overage_micros > 0` — without contaminating real user data.
  2. After invoking `runTrashSweep()`, seeded past-due posts have `trashed_at` set and remain in the database.
  3. After invoking `runPurgeSweep()`, seeded over-retention posts have DB rows removed AND every associated storage object is gone — no orphans left in the bucket.
  4. After invoking `runOverageBillingBatch()`, the expected ledger entries are created for seeded profiles with pending overage and `pending_overage_micros` is reset on success.
  5. The script exits 0 only when all three sweeps produce the expected observable side effects; any deviation produces a non-zero exit and an itemized failure report.
**Plans**: TBD
